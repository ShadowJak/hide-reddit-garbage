## Usage

1. Log into the Reddit account the extension will hide posts on. This extension doesn't ask for nor have access to any account information.

2. Activate the extension by clicking the "Hide Garbage" button which has been added to both new and old Reddit. It can also be started by clicking the extension's icon in the Extensions menu and clicking "Start".

3. The extension opens up a special tab of "old" Reddit and cycles through various subreddits hiding the top five posts from each of those subreddits. It also cycles though "all", "news", and "worldnews" pages so it can hide posts which contain various keywords.

4. By default, all categories for hiding posts are turned on when the extension is installed. To turn off various categories of posts, click the extension's icon from the Chrome Extensions menu (puzzle piece icon) and unselect categories as needed. Note: Many subreddits exist in more than one category.
